Revelations Style Round Sounds
By Shidouri


Step 1:
Drag and drop all folders except usermaps and stock_csv to BO3 root. 

Drop the CONTENTS of YOURMAP into BO3 root/usermaps/YOURMAP.





Step 2:
Add the following to your zone, above scriptparsetree,scripts/zm/YOURMAP.gsc:

scriptparsetree,scripts/zm/zm_zone_specific_round_sounds.gsc






Step 3:
Add the follwing to YOURMAP.gsc, underneath #using scripts\zm\_zm_trap_electric:

// Revelations-style Zone-Specific Round Sounds
#using scripts\zm\zm_zone_specific_round_sounds;






Step 4:
Open BO3 root/usermaps/YOURMAP/sound/zoneconfig/YOURMAP.szc
Directly underneath this:
{
 "Type" : "ALIAS",
 "Name" : "user_aliases",
 "Filename" : "user_aliases.csv",
 "Specs" : [ ] 
},

Add this:
{
 "Type" : "ALIAS",
 "Name" : "rev_style_rounds",
 "Filename" : "rev_style_rounds.csv",
 "Specs" : [ ] 
},


NOTE: If you need help with steps 5 and 6, I've written a tool to help you with adding sounds for this step,
so long as all sounds for each zone are in one folder (or all sounds in total in one folder).

Step 5:

Go to BO3 root/share/raw/sound/aliases and open rev_style_rounds.csv.
Do not edit lines 1 through 16.
Here is where you'll define aliases for each sound.

For example:
rsrs_zone1_start1,,,rev_style_rounds\default\ritual_start1.wav,,,UIN_MOD,,,,,BUS_MUSIC,grp_music,,,,,100,100,,,,,,,,,,,,,,100,100,0,1,,2d,music_all,,NONLOOPING,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,yes,,,,yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"rsrs_zone1_start1" is the sound alias we will use in the GSC in Step 6.
"rev_style_rounds\default\ritual_start1.wav" is the path to the WAV file we want to use in BO3 root/sound_assets/.






Step 6:
We're now going to assign the aliases you just set up, to zones in the game.
Go to BO3 root/usermaps/YOURMAP/scripts/zm/zm_zone_specific_round_sounds.gsc and open it.
Go to line 28 and have a read through to make sure you understand.

FORMAT: 
	level.a_location_round_sound_begin["ZONENAME"] = array("zone1Alias1", "zone1Alias2", "zone1Alias3" [etc]); [NO COMMA ON LAST!]
	level.a_location_round_sound_end["ZONENAME"] = array("zone1Alias1", "zone1Alias2", "zone1Alias3" [etc]); [NO COMMA ON LAST!]

ie.     level.a_location_round_sound_begin["start_zone"] = array("soe_roundstart_1", "soe_roundstart_2", "soe_roundstart_3", "soe_roundstart_4");
	level.a_location_round_sound_end["start_zone"] = array("soe_roundend_1", "soe_roundend_2");

You must set up at least 1 sound for start and end for each zone, otherwise the classic round sounds will be used instead.

If multiple zones are going to use one set of sounds (such as multiple zones for one area):
Assign the first zone it's sounds, and then assign the first zone's array as the value of the others.

For example:
	level.a_location_round_sound_begin["start_zone"] = array("soe_roundstart_1", "soe_roundstart_2", "soe_roundstart_3", "soe_roundstart_4");
	level.a_location_round_sound_begin["zone_3"] = level.a_location_round_sound_begin["start_zone"]

	level.a_location_round_sound_end["start_zone"] = array("soe_roundend_1", "soe_roundend_2", "soe_roundend_3", "soe_roundend_4");
	level.a_location_round_sound_end["zone_3"] = level.a_location_round_sound_end["start_zone"]


Step 7: 
Save everything and compile and link but DON'T run.
snd_convert can be very picky sometimes with new sounds so check for any errors in the linker.
So if you're sure you set everything up correctly, keep trying to link until the errors resolve themselves. Then run and test it out :)


If the earlier rounds are using sounds that are too long for you:
In zm_zone_specific_round_sounds.gsc find the #define for SHORT_SOUND_MAX_TIME and lower it from 25 to 15 maybe.


The default setup for the sounds are a mixture of both Custom Round Sounds Packs by 777TONES on DEVRAW.
If you like the ones I included, you should check out the ones I didn't! Both packs have some great custom sounds!

Please credit myself and 777TONES if you use this in your map.
